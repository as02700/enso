## Returns the method name of the method that could not be found.
No_Such_Method_Error.method_name : Text
No_Such_Method_Error.method_name =
    Meta.meta this.symbol . name

## A type used to represent that something has not yet been implemented.
type Unimplemented_Error message

## A function that can be used to indicate that something hasn't been
   implemented yet.
unimplemented : Text -> Void
unimplemented message="" = Panic.throw (Unimplemented_Error message)

## Executes the provided handler on a dataflow error, or executes as identity on
   a non-error value.

   Arguments:
   - handler: The function to call on this if it is an error value. By default
     this is identity.

   > Example
     Catching an erroneous value to perform some operation on it.
       (Time.Time_Error "Message").catch (err -> IO.println err)
Error.catch : (Error -> Any) -> Any
Error.catch (handler = x->x) = this.catch_primitive handler

## Maps a dataflow error.
   If the original value was a non-error value, it is not affected, but if it
   was an error, the error is mapped through the provided function.

   Arguments:
   - f: The function to transform the error.

   > Example
     Wrapping an error value.
       map.get "x" . map_error (_ -> ElementNotFound "x")
Error.map_error : (Error -> Error) -> Any
Error.map_error f = this.catch (x -> Error.throw (f x))

## Takes any value, and if it is a dataflow error, throws it as a Panic.
   Otherwise, returns the original value unchanged.
Panic.rethrow : (Any ! Any) -> Any
Panic.rethrow value = value.catch Panic.throw
